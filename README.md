# Early-Prediction-of-Cancers-Machine-Learning 
This project will investigate the significance of dataset testing in identifying people who are at high risk of getting particular forms of cancer, specifically thyroid cancer, brain tumors, colon cancer, breast cancer and skin cancer.

**INTRODUCTION**
The technology is now well developed and the new technology gives more accurate
results than the old one. Machine learning is a part of artificial intelligence (AI) that
enables systems to automatically learn based on machine learning algorithms to improve
system performance without programming.

Cancer is a disease that can affect almost any part of a person's body. If not diagnosed
and treated early, it can be fatal. In health informatics, cancer prediction is very important
and we need to track it as soon as possible. As a result, early diagnosis or prediction of
cancer could help many people and reduce the risk of the disease. In fact, early cancer
detection systems can greatly improve the prospects and survival of cancer patients.
When cancer is found early, treatment options are often less invasive and more likely to
be successful.

Therefore, the goal of this project is to make it possible for medical professionals to
efficiently evaluate and diagnose cancer. The created method should make it simpler for
doctors to diagnose patients since it can identify the kind of cancer from the patient's
symptoms and other information.

**OBJECTIVES**
● To identify and verify the best method to analyze selected cancers diseases by using
SVM, RF and KNN techniques.
● To design and develop a prototype using the identified technique for cancer disease
selected.
● To evaluate the accuracy of the prototype in diagnosis of cancers diseases.
